This blog was created for the final project of my machine learning class in Fall 2023 and will be continuously updated.

As a PhD student at Virginia Tech, I am interested in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and Augmented Reality (AR) in engineering fields. In my daily life, I enjoy playing the piano and violin, also various ball games! Living the questions is my joy. :)
